# File Lister
Generates a manifest of files in a given folder. Useful for examinations of a directory tree or validation of the presence of files.

- Generates a directory tree of any folder
- Data can be exported as a CSV file for later validation

All data is kept locally, nothing is transmitted to any servers.

# Validation
To validate a directory against a previously generated manifest

1. Click `validate` at the bottom left of the page to enable the validation button
2. Drag and drop the folder that will be validated. This will generate the manifest
3. Upload the CSV to validate using the Validate CSV button. 

Any errors will be highlighted

- Red = file missing from the CSV
- Yellow = file present but file size differs

The count of files in the CSV but not in the manifest (if any) will also be displayed in a popup.
